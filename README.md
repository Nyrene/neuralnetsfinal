Neural Nets final project - recreating tutorial on classifying dog breeds


To use, please download and unpack the dataset file (2_breeds) to a convenient location. Run all cells on the ipynb file (I used Colab, other options would likely work as well assuming torch libraries are installed) after modifying the dataset filepaths in the first code block.
